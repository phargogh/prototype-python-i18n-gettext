# Prototype Python i18n via stdlib `gettext`

Another natcap project, [OPAL](https://github.com/natcap/opal) used python's
stdlib gettext module to offer translations, which can be a useful resource for
a functioning application.

The goal here is to develop a functional workflow for extracting text strings
from python source and loading them at runtime.
