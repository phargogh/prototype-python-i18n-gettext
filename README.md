# Prototype Python i18n via stdlib `gettext`

Another natcap project, [OPAL](https://github.com/natcap/opal) used python's
stdlib gettext module to offer translations, which can be a useful resource for
a functioning application.

The goal here is to develop a functional workflow for extracting text strings
from python source and loading them at runtime.

## Notes

* Useful definitions for gettext from the [`gawk`
docs](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Explaining-gettext.html)
